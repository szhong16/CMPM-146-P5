- What you changed from the template and why, especially related to your selection strategies,
fitness functions, crossover and mutation operators, etc.

For our selection strategies, we chose roulette and tournament selection because they seemed simple to implement, while effective enough to create very unique and interesting children. We also made changes to how we generate children through the process of determining how genes were distibuted. For our purposes, we split the map up into different sections, with each section representing one of the selected parents. These parents were chosen from our selection strategies and their children generated will then be mutated. In the mutation function, we opted for constraints on how much we could change and if a change was viable. For example, we made sure that there were no walls floating randomly in the air and that pipes were produced correctly, with an entrance and at least one pipe connected.

â€“ Something about each of your two favorite levels: Why do you like them? How many generations
did it take and how many seconds to generate these levels?
